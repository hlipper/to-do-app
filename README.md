# to-do-app
To-Do App Project - Bloc

For this project, I used Javascript and CSS to create a simple to-do-list app.  In this exercise, I also used styles obtained 
[Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/index.html).

I did my best to make this app responsive, though it wasn't part of the assignment.
